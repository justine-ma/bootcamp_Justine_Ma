# Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a data-driven credit risk model that predicts the likelihood of loan default, enabling lenders to make more informed and transparent credit approval decisions. By leveraging historical loan data and modern machine learning techniques, the project aims to improve the accuracy of default predictions compared to traditional scoring methods, while also incorporating explainability tools to ensure regulatory compliance and business trust. Ultimately, the project seeks to help financial institutions reduce losses from defaults, optimize portfolio risk, and expand fair access to credit by distinguishing between high- and low-risk borrowers more effectively.
